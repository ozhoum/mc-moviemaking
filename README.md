# Code Ninjas Moviemaking in Minecraft Server Setup
This is meant as a guide for setting up a server and adding useful plugins for moderation and organisational sake. 
You can find the guide in the wiki tab at the top, or by clicking [here](https://github.com/ozhoum/mc-moviemaking/wiki).
The altered files that were previously used can be found in the `Files` folder, organised the same way as Aternos does. These can be copy and pasted into your own files if you don't want to go through changing any lines.
